# Plaidypus Code Challenge

## Overview

Create a two-page application using the Yelp Fusion API. On the first page, you should be able to search for businesses in Naperville. When you select a result, it should take you to a second page where you can see details about the business.

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to give you a chance to show us your ability to code. We will be looking at how you handle making requests to an API, as well as how you handle the JSON responses. We will also be looking for basic understanding of React components, and for proficiency in javascript (usage of ES6 features is encouraged).

## Setup Instructions

1. Create an account with yelp [here](https://www.yelp.com/signup)
2. [Follow the instructions here to get started with the Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started)
3. Documentation on API usage can be found [here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3). For your application, you will be using the `Search API` and the `Business API`.

## Requirements

* Commit your code to a public repository (using github, bitbucket, or whatever service you prefer).
* Include a README file with instructions on how to run your application.
* You must use React.js or React Native for rendering the UI.
* You may use any javascript framework you are familiar with to create the application â€” Express.js, Sails.js, Meteor.js, React Native, etc.
* You may use frontend UI libraries to make styling easier.
* Everything else is up to you.
